# parameters
#
# The input variable 'data' is an (n+1 x n+2) matrix composed of:
#
# F = flow matrix [nxn]
# z = input vector [nx1]
# x = storage vector [nx1]
# y = output vector [1xn]
# .. a 1x2 vector of zeros.
#
# Sample data from the intertidal oyster reef ecosystem model created by Dame and Patten (1981)
# From Patten (1985).  Model flows are in kcal m^-2 day^-1;
# storage data is kcal m^-2.
